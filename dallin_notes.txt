Questions for 10/21 meeting

1. Toms data.  Is it just the Property assessment fy22 data cleaned?
Isn't this analyze Boston?

Boston Affordable Housing Stock Data has no pid, (not from analyze Boston)
Income restricted properties in Boston (Analyze Boston) has no p_id (also, no address, can we get address)
The above 2 are different things? 


Property assessment fy22 - looks like toms data, does have pid, but we thinks its the same thing (same columns we thing)

Is there anything besides OWN_OCC that designates as small? 



 _______________________________________________
Income restricted data sources relationship

Income restricted: google places api to use the project name and get address..

Category search link?

To answer: what types of units are most available as low income?

Differentiate occupied by people who own their units, or condo where there are 5 condo units.   
People who own Rental properties that could accept low income with housing voucher.  

Keep out condos, back pocket.  Rented units. 

Toms data IS the property assessment data. It is filtered, he did not really explain why it was different. 

Zipcodes are note neighborhoods.  He cares more about neighborhoods

Shape file for neighborhoods

Housing navigator is tough says tom. 

Who would be receptive to accepting affordable voucher.  
There are 2 ways to have affordable.  One is where the unit is restricted:only rented to certain income. 



Other is to subsidize the person. 

Small properties is 6 units.  One of the dudes was interested in "small" properties.  

Look at the size of the properties that have participated.  Hard to make small properties work for these programs.  

Affordable housing definition is broad.  Ok duh.  Make sure you understand what affordable definition means.  


Looking for the human element: where your landlord lives with you knows you and wants to rent to the right people. 

What about the people that want to do it for the dollars?
