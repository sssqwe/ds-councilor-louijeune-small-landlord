## What is the project focus/overall goal?

According to the document provided to us, the project focus/overall goal is to “create a pathway for owner-occupied and small landlords (rather than commercial landlords) that could be added to a database of affordable housing units available to tenants qualified for affordable rental housing”. During our first meeting, they discussed that housing is expensive in Boston and that they want to figure out a way to make a difference by adding “owner occupied and small landlords” to the database, so that they can become another option for people looking for housing. As part of this process, they want us to understand, from the client, what they’re missing from the database when it comes to small properties.

## What type of data will you collect or be analyzing?

According to what was discussed in our first meeting, we will be analyzing data on the housing situation in Boston. They have provided us with many links to websites that hold information on just about every building in Boston. These databases contain information such as the street address, the purpose of the building, the owner, whether it is residential or commercial, whether or not it is in the income-restricted housing inventory, etc.

## What are potential limitations of the project?

According to what was discussed in our first meeting, it is hard to get all the data as the deals regarding renting are sometimes private. Another limitation is how to link the data from the different datasets together. They said that they might add Building IDs to make it easier, but that for now, we can try to correlate the data by using the location data that is provided.

## Why is this project important or Why did you choose this project?

Right now, there isn’t much information on who is being displaced as well as who is having trouble finding housing. They believe that by doing this project, we can possibly figure out the answers to these questions. Successfully completing the project goal could also result in better housing options for current and future Boston residents. We chose to do this project because we wanted to be able to work on something that could really impact the community that we’ve been a part of for the last few years and possibly even impact us.

## What are your team’s next steps? (include action items/tasks)

Based on what we discussed in the meeting, logistical tasks include getting our communication channels organized and set up, joining the slack that the PM will set up, picking a team lead, and picking a time and date for weekly meetings. When it comes to technical tasks, they want us to get familiarized with the data and then start working on the base project (the steps are provided in a document that they shared with us) which is supposed to get all of the different teams to the same level set.
